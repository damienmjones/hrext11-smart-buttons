Button automation scheduler

The problem being solved, which, admittedly is pretty personal to me:
Right now, I have an internet-enabled physical button that can be configured to ping a specific (but static) URL
The Smart Lights I have allow you to write "scenes" that can you can address from a URL in IFTTT.
It works OK, but I want the button to be smart enough to do different things at different times

TO THAT END:
I want to make a scheduler that allows you to enter in (potentially overlapping) scheduling "rules" that dictate what automation gets executed by a buton press based on the current time and date.



Prerequisites (already done)
----------------------------
Make a bunch of test lighting schemas via IFTTT
Make PHP page that hits a previously-created IFTTT process by name
Buy an internet-enabled "Flic" button that can be configured to hit a URL

Logic to calculate based on the present time which automation should apply
Use weighted cascading logic, if possible - (base this on recency of rule?)
